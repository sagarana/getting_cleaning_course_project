# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository contains data, documentation, and files for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course provided on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University.

The project involves processing an existing data set of smartphone sensor data to produce a derived data set that contains the mean values for a subset of the features in the original data.

## Repository contents

-   `original_UCI_HAR_data` - The source data set provided as part of the assignment. Includes information about original data collection and variables. The source data is included for reference and reproducibility.
-   `run_analysis.R` - The script that draws from the source data and documentation to produce the derived data set. The script file includes the assignment instructions and notes about how the data is processed.
-   `tidy_averages.csv` - The derived data set, presented as tidy data with one observation per row and one column with the calculated means.
-   `CodeBook.md` - A code book with information about the derived data set.
